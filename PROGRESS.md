- Map interaction is intuitive
- Privacy controls are clear
- 3-step wizard guides users nicely
- Design looks professional

### What Needs Improvement:
- Need Google OAuth configured to test auth

- Loading states could be better
- Error messages could be more helpful

### User Feedback Needed:
- Is the privacy explanation clear enough?
- Is the 3-step flow too long?
- Should we auto-detect location by default?
- Do we need more photo upload tips?

## 📞 Support Needed

**To fully activate:**
1. Google OAuth credentials
2. Test observation submission end-to-end
3. Test with real users
4. Gather feedback on UX

**Optional for later:**
- OpenAI API key for real AI
