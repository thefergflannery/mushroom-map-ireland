   - Fix leaderboard updates

2. **Map Filtering** (High Value - 3-4 hours)
   - Add species filter to map
   - Add date range filter
   - Add status filter (Needs ID, Consensus, etc.)

3. **Content Expansion** (High Value - Ongoing)
   - Add 10-20 more Irish species
   - Expand glossary terms
   - Improve species descriptions

4. **Performance** (Medium Priority - 2-3 hours)
   - Add caching for species list
   - Optimize map marker rendering
   - Add loading states

## üìû Need Help With?

If you want to tackle any of these:

- **Map Filtering**: I can add species/date/status filters to the map
- **Bug Fixes**: I can debug and fix the reported issues
- **Content**: I can help structure data for more species/glossary terms
- **Performance**: I can add caching and optimizations
- **Testing**: I can set up and expand test coverage

Just let me know what you'd like to focus on next! üöÄ
